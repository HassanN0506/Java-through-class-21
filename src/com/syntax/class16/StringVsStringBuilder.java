        //sB has now been changed, NOT JUST the printout, because w/ StringBuilder, ANY modification made is saved in StringBuilder

        //to change a String, we must explicitly do so, but StringBuilder gets modified WHENEVER WE CALL A METHOD to it

        //sB=sB+"HAhaHAha"; ERROR!!!!!!!!
        //we cannot CONCATENATE a StringBuilder, so we APPEND instead:
        sB.append("HAhaHAha");

        //StringBuilder take up more memory than String, so String is preferred
        //Only use StringBuilder when you know you need to manipulate it with methods often
        //however, StringBuilder processes faster, so if SPEED is priority over MEMORY, then use StringBuilder.

        //String objects are "IMMUTABLE", meaning they can't be modified unless you force it

        //StringBuilder is "Mutable", meaning it can be modified

        StringBuilder str= new StringBuilder("666");
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
            str.append(i);
        }
        System.out.println(str);

        //append, reverse, and toString can only be used in StringBuilder class (not for Strings)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
