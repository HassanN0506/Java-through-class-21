Types of variables:

2 categories of data types: primitive and non-primitive
8 primitive data types: boolean, byte, short, int, double, long, float, char

There are 3 types of variables: local, instance, and static
LOCAL variables are inside a method
INSTANCE variables are inside a class BUT NOT inside a  method
STATIC variables are instance variable, but they have STATIC keyword in front of them

example:
class Vars{

int age=24; // INSTANCE VARIABLE
static double weight=225; //STATIC VARIABLE

    void method(){
        String name = "Hassan"; //LOCAL VARIABLE
    }
}

Local variable:
If a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block of code,
it is called a LOCAL VARIABLE.
Do not get a default value!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Instance variable:
If a variable is not declare inside a method, but it is inside a class,
then it is called an INSTANCE VARIABLE.
cannot be re-initialized (change the value later on in a further line of code) inside the class.
That has to be done inside a method!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Static variable (AKA 'class variables'):
If a variable is not declare inside a method, but it is inside a class, AND IT STARTS WITH THE
'STATIC' KEYWORD, then it is called a static variable.
If you change this in further code in the Main method, it will change it for ALL the objects in the class it was created in
(and change the printout of the previous lines' of code) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

----------

When to use which type of variable?

Local:
ALWAYS preferred over instance and static variables (whenever applicable).
Why? because they occupy the computers' memory for a very, very short amount of time.
As soon as their purpose is served, Java destroys them (and then recreates them whenever needed).
Pros: Save memory
Cons: not accessible outside the method/block of code
//LOCAL VARIABLES CANNOT BE STATIC

Instance:
Used when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class,
AND the information is expected to be different from object to object.
Pros: Accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons: Occupy the computers' memory for longer than Local variable, slowing execution time

Static:
When we know the information will stay the same for all the objects of the class.
Same as instance, but the information IS NOT expected to differ from object to object.
Pros: Single memory location for all the object of a clas (takes up less memory space)
Cons: Stay for longer in the memory, and can only hold 1 value at a time.
//CANNOT BE LOCAL!!!!
