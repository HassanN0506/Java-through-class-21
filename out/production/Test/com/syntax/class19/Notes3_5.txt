Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members(fields, methods, constructors, etc.)
and classes, themselves, in Java.

There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these access levels.
4th level is applied when we don't use any access modifier keyword.

Levels from most-restricted to least-restricted:        !!!!!!!!!
Private, Default, Protected, Public.

Rules:
-We should always prefer private access modifier for the FIELDS, because fields contain the data,
and the methods of your class might use that data to preform some tasks. If we don't preform sanity checks
before setting the values of these fields, our classes and methods might misbehave. Also, the access of data
should be Restricted, so that not everyone can access the data.
-We can't use access modifiers with LOCAL variables.

Most of the time, the FIELDS are aet to Private, and the METHODS are set to Public.

==============================================================================================================
Constructors:
Constructors in java allow us to set the values of the fields of a class.

the "this" keyword ALWAYS refers to the INSTANCE variable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Constructors will MOSTLY be public, and if not public, then default.

Main purpose of constructors is to initialize the fields of a class

Constructor chaining --> calling 1 constructor into another constructor
the 'Outer' constrictor must have parameters that are used with the 'Inner' constructor(s)
the 'inner' constructor is executed firs, and then the rest of the code in the 'outer' constructor is executed
Syntax:
this(parameters of 'inner' constructor);
